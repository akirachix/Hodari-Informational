            <p>We provide a credit scoring system that generates a credit score based on information such as regular utility payments, 
                savings, farmer's milk collections, and other sources of income; higher scores denote a lower default risk.
                 Lenders use this score to determine the risk of granting credit or approving loans, 
                 which affects the conditions and interest rates of those loans.</p>
